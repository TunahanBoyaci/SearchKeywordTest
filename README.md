## Overview
This test case is meant to verify the search functionality of a web application. It takes input parameters for the keyword to search, as well as the login credentials (username and password) required to access the search feature. The test logs in, performs a search with the given keyword, and then checks that each search result contains the keyword in its text. If any result doesn't meet this criteria, the test will fail.
